This is a supplementary material for the paper entitled "Selective Applicative Functors", containing Coq proofs for various selective instances. The material has been anonymised for blind review.

# Try it out

To play with the definitions and proofs, you'll need to have to install the Coq proof assistant. The proofs can be checked by running `make`.

# Acknowledgements

We borrowed many standard definitions form the magnificent
[coq-haskell](https://github.com/jwiegley/coq-haskell) library.
